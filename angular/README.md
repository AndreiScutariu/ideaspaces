# Ideaspaces GUI

The application GUI is built with Angular and it relies on the microservices to run various functionalities.

The ideas get created, read or deleted by the service built on top of the Node.JS stack, while the user management is handled by the JAVA app.

There are two more PHP services, one for sending email notifications and one for persistance of Doodles, but those are not yet integrated. Yet :)
